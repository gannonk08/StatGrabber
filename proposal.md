### First Project Proposal Idea

StatGrabber will scrape statistics off of a sports website and format it into an API end point.

**What problem does your project solve?**

Sports statistics APIs are few and far between and at that are expensive for a practical/hobby use.

**Who has this problem?**

Developers needing realtime statistics for smaller apps

**How will your project solve this problem?**

By providing a simple, intuitive  
routing system, users will be able to create their own scraped APIs


**What inputs does it need?**

The user will need to input a espn url as a query parameter and StatGrabber will do the rest!  

**What outputs does it produce?**

StatGrabber will return a preformatted JSON with the results of the scrape

**What web APIs will it use?**

StatGrabber will not use any APIs! It makes its own!

**What technologies will it use?**

StatGrabber uses a combination of python, postgresSQL, and other python packages

**What additional features will it have?**

Ideally StatGrabber will be able to handle multiple sports websites to scrape.
